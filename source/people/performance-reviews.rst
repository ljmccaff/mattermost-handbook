Performance Review Process
==========================

Performance reviews take place at least once annually. Our review process follows the "360 review" style, which incorporates feedback from peers, direct reports, and managers. 

Reviewee Criteria
-----------------

Full-time staff members who have been with the company for more than three months receive a review.  

The type of review received depends on the length of time the person has been on the team: 

- **Informal Review**: Takes place when staff have been with the company between 90 days and 6 months. 
- **Formal Review**: Takes place when staff have been with the company for more than 6 months. 

Informal Review Process
-----------------------

1. **Feedback panel requests.** You begin the process by providing names of 3-6 teammates who can most effectively provide feedback on your achievements and performance over the past year. Community members can be included in addition to staff.
2. **Feedback panel selection.** Your manager takes your input along with other managers’ input to select teammates and community members from the list provided to give feedback on your performance.
3. **Peer feedback.** Your manager reaches out directly to gather feedback from your peers. They will NOT be sent a feedback review survey.  
4. **Review discussion.** Your manager reviews your performance eval feedback with you. This may be shared in an informal format instead of using the formal review template. 


Formal Review Process
---------------------

1. **Confirm level expectations for roles are up to date.** Managers review the role level descriptions. Any necessary updates are made before the review cycle begins. 
2. **Manager preparation.** Before each review cycle, managers read the performance review chapter in High Output Management. After reading the chapter, any new managers have a 30 minute meeting scheduled with their manager and the CEO to set expectations for the review process. 
3. **Feedback panel requests.** You begin the process by providing names of 3-6 teammates who can most effectively provide feedback on your achievements and performance over the past year. Community members can be included in addition to staff.

5. **Peer feedback.** Your teammates receive a request to complete the annual review feedback survey within 2 weeks. On average, teammates should be completing feedback surveys for 3 to 6 of their teammates. 
6. **Self reflection.** At the same time as the peer feedback, you are sent a self-evaluation survey to complete within 2 weeks. 
7. **Review compilation.** HR collects all reviews and shares them with your manager. 
8. **Annual review draft.** Your manager reads all feedback from the surveys and incorporates their own observations. They then draft performance reviews based on the `performance review template <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C1BY8h6dZVQIuQd_vxRy1S-3f1lhAdtM5frIATmUG5A/edit?ts=5bf46661#heading=h.hu5vu6dn98iw>`_. In addition to the feedback recieved, reviews also take into consideration the expectations for your role and level, and performance relative to your teammates.
