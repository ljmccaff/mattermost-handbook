# WIP: Onboarding at Mattermost

## General Onboarding

### Welcome to Mattermost

We’re on a mission to make the world safer and more productive through open source. To make that happen we first have to create a great place to work--an inclusive, courteous online community where incredibly talented individuals are empowered to do their best work for our customers, with very little in their way. This book is a summary of our guiding principles. As Mattermost grows, we hope these principles serve each new staff person that joins us. If you are new to Mattermost, welcome! While the goals here are important, it’s your ideas, talent, and energy that will keep Mattermost shining in the years ahead. Thanks for being here. Let’s change the world.
