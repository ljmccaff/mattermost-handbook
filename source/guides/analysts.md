## Suggested Flow for Briefings

- Explain Mattermost's definition of “high trust enterprise”, and clearly highlight the unique requirements of such organizations

- Double click on data ownership, hosted offering, privacy / regulatory issues within high trust organizations and connect the dots on how this translates to collaboration platform selection

- Explain how DevOps teams / large dev teams have specific requirements that exceed the capabilities of tools like Slack and Teams

- Demo the product to show unique functionality with very high value prop to developers

- Connect the narrative back to trust / security for large dev teams and make sure that differentiation is the final thing they take away from the briefing  

- Leave 10 mins at the end of the call for Q&A / feedback where possible
