# How to procure at Mattermost 

## IMPORTANT: Mattermost runs its own e-sign process

DO NOT have vendors send e-sign to Mattermost staff. Mattermost needs all e-sign to be setup using Mattermost e-sign systems by the following people: 

- PeopleOps and Consulting Agreements (HelloSign) - Jen Shepard 
- Customer and Partner Agreements (DocuSign) - Melissa Warner 
- Subscription Software Services (DocuSign) - Camille Harris 

The e-signed documents are organized and archived based on e-sign manager. 

If a vendor needs to use e-sign through their system an exception can be made via written agreement by Mattermost CEO.
